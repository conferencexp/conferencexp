Interop.MessengerAPI.dll
========================

WindowsXP comes with Windows Messenger pre-installed, which supports the Messenger APIs through IMessenger3.  Windows Vista does not come with Windows Messenger, but instead provides a shortcut link for downloading Windows Live Messenger, which supports the Messenger APIs through IMessenger4.

Due to build warnings generated by the Messenger APIs in Vista, we decided to create a binary reference to the Interop.MessengerAPI.dll generated on a WindowsXP machine, since it is the least common denominator.  If you want or need the IMessenger4 functionality, feel free to adjust the Reference accordingly.
